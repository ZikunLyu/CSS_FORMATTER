# CSS FORMATTER
This CSS Formatter is created while I was learning how to add some fancy animation in my website.
Usage:
If you find some fancy websites or webpages, and their css files are massive, using this Css Formatter will automaticlly clearup and format this css file for you.
1. Put your css file within the same directory as this CSS Formatter
2. Run this cssformatter.c file and typein the file name you want to format wth (ending with .css)
3. A file called formatted.css will be generated automatically
4. You are all set

You still could use Chrome Extension called "JavaScript and CSS Code Beautifier" which could beautify both CSS and JS LOL!!!
